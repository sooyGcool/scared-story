        <h1>scared story</h1>
        <p id="first">An ordinary day in Stockholm, Sweden,</p>
        <p id="second" class="text">you decide to go for a walk.</p>
        <p id="third" class="text">
          Your destination is the forest, in search of fun
        </p>

        <p id="fourth" class="text">
          What you like most are mysteries and secrets.
        </p>

        <p id="fifth" class="text">
          So you go determined to find mysteries or anomalies.
        </p>

        <p id="six" class="text">You plan to do this at night.</p>

        <p id="seven" class="text">
          You have everything you need: a tent to sleep in, armor, and food.
        </p>

        <p id="eight" class="text">
          You search and search for something unusual or striking, but you find
          nothing.
        </p>

        <p id="nine" class="text">
          You’ve explored a lot, but without finding anything,
          so you decide to sleep for a while.
        </p>

        <p id="ten" class="text">
          At least an hour to have energy and explore more, you sleep.
        </p>

        <p id="eleven" class="text">
          You wake up in a rather terrifying place.
        </p>

        <p id="twelve" class="text">
          You find yourself in a room, everything is black.
        </p>

        <p id="thirteen" class="text">
          It seems that the kidnapper locked you up.
        </p>

        <p id="fourteen" class="text">
          You only have your backpack, but there’s nothing inside.
        </p>

        <p id="fifteen" class="text">On the floor, there’s a baseball bat.</p>

        <p id="sixteen" class="text">
          The door is locked, there’s a window, so you use the bat and break it.
        </p>

        <p id="seventeen" class="text">You go out and it’s still night.</p>

        <p id="eighteen" class="text">
          Apparently, you’re in a cabin on top of a mountain.
        </p>

        <p id="nineteen" class="text">
          The cabin has almost no light and seems quite abandoned.
        </p>

        <p id="twenty" class="text">
          Unfortunately, you left the bat in the room and you can’t go back to
          get it.
        </p>

        <p id="twenty-one" class="text">Now you’re defenseless.</p>

        <p id="twenty-two" class="text">You decide to explore the cabin.</p>

        <p id="twenty-three" class="text">
          You enter a room where you find your things and a medieval sword.
        </p>

        <p id="twenty-four" class="text">That’s enough to fight.</p>

        <p id="twenty-five" class="text">
          You put on your armor and prepare for whatever may happen.
        </p>

        <p id="text-26" class="text">
          You walk quietly, attentive to everything that may happen.
        </p>

        <p id="text-27" class="text">
          Suddenly, someone surprises you from behind but tells you that he
          won’t hurt you because he was also kidnapped.
        </p>

        <p id="text-28" class="text">He’s just another survivor.</p>

        <p id="text-29" class="text">
          Still, he seems a bit suspicious because it seems like he just fought,
          so you stay on guard against him.
        </p>

        <p id="text-30" class="text">You go together.</p>

        <p id="text-31" class="text">
          He starts telling you that the one who locked him up is a killer, some
          kind of psychopath.
        </p>

        <p id="text-32" class="text">
          You ask him how he ended up here, he tells you that he was camping
          quietly in the forest and just appeared there.
        </p>

        <p id="text-33" class="text">
          You start to suspect but at the same time, you don’t believe that a
          guy as nice as him is a serial killer so you continue together.
        </p>

        <p id="text-34" class="text">Suddenly you hear screams.</p>

        <p id="text-35" class="text">
          You run to see what that was, maybe they were the screams of the next
          victim of the killer.
        </p>

        <p id="text-36" class="text">
          You find a woman with a knife, apparently she killed someone.
        </p>

        <p id="text-37" class="text">
          You think she is the killer so you threaten her but she tells you that
          it’s not her and that the one she killed was the killer because he
          defended himself from him.
        </p>

        <p id="text-38" class="text">You don’t believe her.</p>

        <p id="text-39" class="text">Gunshots are heard, she runs away scared and leaves you alone.</p>

        <p id="text-40" class="text">Apparently, the survivor is no longer there.</p>

        <p id="text-41" class="text">You’re confused so you go to the place of the shots prepared for a possible battle.</p>

        <p id="text-42" class="text">When you arrive at the place, you see the woman lying on the ground with no signs of life.</p>

        <p id="text-43" class="text">The survivor who you thought was kind and just another survivor appears.</p>

        <p id="text-44" class="text">Apparently, he was behind all this.</p>

        <p id="text-45" class="text">He tells you it was easy to fool you.</p>

        <p id="text-46" class="text">He was the real killer.</p>

        <p id="text-47" class="text">He shoots you and you fall to the ground and at that moment you remember that the person who the woman killed was wearing the same clothes as the real killer.</p>

        <p id="text-48" class="text">Apparently you deduce that the killer dressed like the survivors so that other survivors would confuse him with him and thus gain time and eliminate each other.</p>

        <p id="text-49" class="text">With a lot of impotence, you get up and decide to face him.</p>

        <p id="text-50" class="text">You are very skilled with swords and are very agile.</p>

        <p id="text-51" class="text">The problem is that he has a weapon although your armor is quite resistant with 3 shots could kill you without options and with a great possibility of dying give everything.</p>

        <p id="text-52" class="text">You approach and split two of his bullets with your sword.</p>

        <p id="text-53" class="text">You’re about to finish him off when he decides to escape.</p>

        <p id="text-54" class="text">He runs away and it becomes a chase.</p>

        <p id="text-55" class="text">He is very fast but you are too and you are also an expert in parkour and it seems that he also knows but not as much as you.</p>

        <p id="text-56" class="text">It’s an intense chase, you’re about to catch him but he stops and pulls out a sword.</p>

        <p id="text-57" class="text">You also pull out your sword and a battle begins in which both of you are good already you feel tired suddenly you feel a magical sensation you feel power suddenly a blue magical power comes out that power merges with your armor and sword and you manage to defeat him</p>
        <p id="text-58" class="text">you ask him why he did it?</p>
        <p id="text-59" class="text">He just faints.</p>   
        <p id="text-60" class="text">You call the police and they arrest him then at home</p>

        <p id="text-61" class="text">you see on the news that the man you caught was sentenced to life imprisonment</p>
        <p id="text-62" class="text">he looks at the camera and points I will catch you</p>
        <p id="text-63" class="text">that leaves you with chills and fear of his return.</p>

    
        <p id="end" class="text">end</p>
